I've made a PHP debugger, give it a try at [chevere/xr](https://github.com/chevere/xr).

To end 2021 I gave myself a few days to create a *different* piece of software and I ended up building a lightweight PHP debugger, which is a type of software used for developers to retrieve *dump information* about *things* happening in a software system.

🦄 I spawned this software in less than one week. I did this for the fun of creating something, and for the sake of a distraction-free lightweight debug experience.

## Introducing XR

XR is a debugger where *dump messages*, emitted from your code,  gets streamed to a debug server

XR is a software that started to grow on me the first time I saw [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray). I noticed that the Ray debug approach could suit me better and benefit my Tech Support clients, but I wanted a different user interface and portability of the debug sessions.

## Features

### ✨ Dump variables

You can dump single or multiple arguments and use named arguments for increased context.

```php
xr('Hello, world!);
xr($var1, $var2, ..., $varN+1);
xr(one: $var1, cloned: $var2);
```

### 😊 One-click server

XR server runs on top of ReactPHP, no extra dependencies required. It will run in *any### compatible PHP system!

### 👻 Filtering

Filter messages by topics and/or emotes as XR doesn't restrict you to log levels, colors, events or anything. You build the context which each message delivered.

### 📟 Backtrace

Understand the call stack related to any section of your code and only when you need it.

### 🌚🌝 Dark/Light modes

XR comes with a theme which follows your system preferences with automatic dark/light mode switch.

### 👽 Ephemeral

And it's gone! XR doesn't require to store any persistent data. No database required.

### 🍒 HTML based

XR user interface is HTML. You can benefit from all the goodies including customization, save your session for offline usage, add as shortcut app, etc.
