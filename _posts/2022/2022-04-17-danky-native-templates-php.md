`🚧 under preview`

When it comes to templates there are two distinctive approaches. You have raw code, and template-syntax where there's no programing language but placeholders for limited programming functionality.

Code below is a raw template, where you use a PHP file with explicit `<?php` placeholders for PHP syntax. This is the primitive way to create templates.

```php
// greet.php

<h1><?php echo $greet; ?></h1>
```

Then there's template-syntax, which appeared as an answer to how ugly and unsafe it gets to create raw templates.

```php
// greet.tpl

<h1>{{ greet }}</h1>
```

😣 I never liked any of these alternatives. This is because in both cases you end up with template file without any context.

## The problem with templates

I get the idea of these template files being anon bytes of code that can be re-used. But I don't see why these need to be **not scoped** and **not declare** the variables it needs to handle.

This brings a lot of issues:

* Unrestricted access to data (raw templates).
* Requires introspection to know which variables are required.
* Can't tell if the template is missing a variable unless it panics.
* Templates gets harder to test.

## My solution

If templates where **classes**, they will declare its scope and variables, adding context for these. This enables to easier detect issues on template wiring and to enforce types on variables, making templates trivial to tests.

😘 In this post I introduce [Danky](https://chevere.org/packages/danky), which I created to avoid the caveats of traditional template systems.

## What is Danky?

![Danky](/logos/chevere/packages/danky/danky-social-alt.svg)

Danky is a native template system for PHP. Contrary to all other template systems and engines, in Danky **templates are classes**.

🦄 In Danky, templates **explicit declare** its scope.

```php
<?php // Quote.php

use Chevere\Danky\Template;

class Quote extends Template
{
    public function __construct(string $text, string $author) {
        $this->render =
            <<<HTML
            <quote>"$text" --$author</quote>
            HTML;
    }
};
```

That `<<<HTML ...` is [Heredoc](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.heredoc) syntax [string literal](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php). In Danky, you use all the stuff that _has been always there_ to handle multi-line string literals. Heredoc is great for templates as it evaluates variables, making templates clean to read.

```php
<?php
echo
    new Quote(
        text: 'Hello, world!',
        author: 'Rodolfo'
    );
```

Which produces:

```html
<main>
    <quote>"Hello, world!" --Rodolfo</quote>
</main>
```

🥳 **Congratulations**! You mastered Danky.
