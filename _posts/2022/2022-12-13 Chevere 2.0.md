A new major Chevere version is available at [chevere/chevere](https://github.com/chevere/chevere). For this one I added new features to the library and I'm very happy to being capable of keeping a steady development pace considering that `1.0.0` was released on August 2022.

While Chevere from `0.1` to `1.0` was made around *Macanudo* ([Chevereto V4.0](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/introduction/changelog/4.0.html)) Chevere `2.0` is build around [Chevereto Cloud](https:/chevereto.cloud/) which is a new SaaS that I'm building on top of [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src). The objective is to use Chevere for what it was conceived on the first place: [Stateful systems](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/stateful-vs-stateless).

As the base Chevere library evolves so does the packages. I have shipped a considerable quality bump driven by PHPStan Level 9 and Mutation testing in all published packages.

*!Larga vida a Chevere software!*
