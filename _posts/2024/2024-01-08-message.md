New from Chevere is the [Message](https://chevere.org/packages/message) package. This software enables to create strings with template tags support.

This package is basic and straightforward. It provides the `message` function which you use by passing the message template and replacement tags.

```php
use function Chevere\Message\message;

$template = "I'm the {{what}}, {{what}}, {{name}}";
message(
    $template,
    what: 'miggida',
    name: 'Mac Daddy',
);
// I'm the miggida, miggida, Mac Daddy
```

By passing the template you can generate different messages:

```php
message(
    $template,
    what: 'chicka',
    name: 'McLovin',
);
// I'm the chicka, chicka, McLovin
```

And that's it. Simple and easy.

I use this package a lot in my projects as it's very useful to generate messages with dynamic content. My main use case is for creating error messages, but it can be used for anything.
