For a couple of years I've been analyzing and testing, to try to witness directly why and how my support offering got broken. In this post I review why my support went that way and what I'm doing to fix it for good.

Although the following content is taken from my little business realm, perhaps my root problem is the same thing affecting others providing bad support? Your feedback is welcome.

## Frustration

🤬 The software rely in so many technologies that most users **get easily frustrated** with the subtle tech terminology and concepts.

❌ Avoid interacting with an impatient or angry user. Do not touch!.

✅ I found that the best course of action is to wait until the user slow down. By doing that, most users give it another try later, with a cool head and most of the time my intervention is totally unnecessary.

## Variable demand

😨 Support demand suffers from **unpredictable spikes**.

Is normal to get support demand spikes after a new release or any breaking change, problem is that is hard to tell how tall the tide will be every time.

❌ Support offerings are fixed, you need time to train people and to write documentation. You won't ever match the speed required by a spike.

✅ It worked great to narrow the problem to progressively deliver the software updates to small batches of users.

## Flat rates

🤯 Any flat support offering will **get abused**.

To include an uncapped layer of support will force that activity to be driven as an overselling business model, where users never using support will pay the bill for those folks sending you 40 emails in one morning (true story).

❌ Users will abuse when possible, allowing that will decrease the value of your work.

✅ Support should be charged on a per-event basis. You don't want to deal with abusers as once their start they won't ever stop.

⭐ Offering a **support insurance** subscription covering up to $X support cost per year is the way to go, just like insurance companies do.

## Worry too much

😢 Worrying too much is **highly counterproductive** for me.

I'm always being told that I'm the kind of person that worries too much, that I always aim for the extra mile. After many years in that train I'm sure that it is a really bad course of action as it gives the user a wrong idea of the value of your time.

❌ Being of top of everything is like spoiling a little child. Users will forget that they are users and will became kids of you, depending entirely on you to debug, fix simple issues and ultimate to reason.

✅ Leave users in the wild, let them grow as peers, you don't want zombies. Don't explain your design decisions to people won't make any use of it. Don't reply to create "searchable content". To summarize, don't waste your time.

⭐ Charge money for those needing your extra care and touch, if they pay they value you.

## Bad communication

🥴 Some users don't have a compelling tech vocabulary, causing **communication jam**.

Cultural differences and language barriers will also play a role. Some users want to be greet and handled as if I were Adobe, chatter five minutes before cutting to the chase, or get easily offended by a translation issue or the use of certain word.

❌ Users not being able to communicate are really hard to handle. At times I require to explain things over and over and most of the time it ends bad anyway.

✅ Don't provide support for those who can't communicate in a reasonable manner.

⭐ Worse that will happen is that you will save a headache. If there too many users with this problem, they will end up forming their own user community around your software.

## Overlapping

😵 Users with lack of tech knowledge won't be capable to differentiate what's **your responsibility** and that is a system requirement.

❌ Some of these users won't take a "no" for answer and will demand for support for stuff which is not under your responsibility. They will find all the arguments in the world to make you help them. They will use pity, public exposure, defamation, disavowing and anything in their reach to make you feel bad for not helping.

> A term in Chilean Spanish for this kind of stubborn user is "Barsa culiao".

It gets worse when the user is forwarded from the hosting company, which simply throws back all issues to the software authors. This is a common practice, _más vieja que sentarse con el poto_, they re-sell servers and expect software authors to do the rest.

✅ Do not provide support for stuff you don't sell, even if your software stops working.

## Get it fixed

After getting all this out my chest I'm sure that the problem is caused by me, for my lack of professionalism in this matter, for not being able to get these noises out of my head.

So I've started changes in [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) that I hope will help me to drive better support:

* I won't handle any careless ticket
* Chevereto-Free won't get any Tech support anymore, only community support
* Ticket response time is now 48 hours
* Extra support is now available to purchase from (faster response time)
* I won't engage with community support

## What now?
