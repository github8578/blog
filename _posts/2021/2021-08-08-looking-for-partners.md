I'm looking for partners that want to join me at Chevereto for its new generation, where by updating its tech I'm pushing the project forward towards dramatically increase the user base. For this to happen Chevereto not only requires a new tech foundation but also a new offering and servicing, that's where I'm looking for help.

When I first started doing software for money I got scammed by my partner back then. This was when I was just a WordPress template designer and he run away with 50% of the commission. This unfortunate incident pushed me to learn server-side programming and for my luck, I liked this job way better than frontend! so from there my attitude has been pretty much "OK, another thing to learn" and I took the chance to use my time to try out all the possible jobs in Chevereto.

I started with front design then I quickly moved to backend development and Tech Support. I also do sales, marketing, customer relationship, documenting, infra provisioning, etc. Out of the sole need of selling my own software product I ended doing multiple different jobs that are normally carried by teams of people.

## Learnings

After all these years I've came to the conclusion that my higher proficiency is at everything software-development related. At that department I'm capable of pulling out stuff way quicker than the industry standard, but as I suck on everything else the final product is just lacking.

Long ago I learned that to sell more software I need to build more solutions. Putting more features to existing software is not that important as spawn new and highly specialized solutions. I'm confident in that I can build an outstanding development team, but I can't do the same for sales or customer relationship or any other non-dev related area.

The anxiety of sales or whatever else ends killing the software products, and the only way to don't suffer from that is with a rich catalog of applications and services.

## What I'm looking for?

I'm looking for founders who can help me to push Chevereto to the next level. The product and its manufacturing is covered, it just lacks everything else and that's where you can make an impact. I expect founders to invest resources in this, specially time. I'm OK if you can offer just part-time or try it out for a few weeks.

If you are already working at the software industry or if you worked before on it that's a really nice have, but that's not mandatory.

## What I'm offering?

I've the entire development layer covered, for a software which peaked 15K installations (each installation serves N users). I've that part very matured, won't be an issue.

All remote based, and from any nationality, place or culture. I don't have any issues with who you are neither where you came from. I also don't care to ask about formal education.

I can summarize the offering in that you will get yourself involved in the manufacturing of all sorts of cool software products. That you will be partner of this, that your opinion and experience will determine the develop of new software products.
