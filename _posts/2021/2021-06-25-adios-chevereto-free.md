summary: Why I'm shutting down my Open Source software?

In 2016 I released [Chevereto-Free 1.0.0](https://github.com/Chevereto/Chevereto-Free/releases/tag/1.0.0) with the goal of building a new audience and to also discourage piracy of my stuff. I did this move because I wanted to turn the project into a collaborative initiative as I was getting burned with the never ending "can you add X please?" or the "add this and you will make rich!" feedback.

I was expecting people to join development and that some users will upgrade to paid edition to make myself a decent income. The idea was to use this Open Source edition as marketing for my work by gifting ongoing releases based on the paid edition to the community.

## Users don't contribute

Chevereto-Free right is currently used in ~4K systems and it totals ~10K installations (per domain). Out of these it converted less than 1%, meaning that I needed another order of magnitude in distribution to get a meaningful figure. The user base needs to be huge to get a decent living from this.

But that's OK! I knew the 1% rule I don't live under a rock. Thing is that I was expecting **collaboration** not people using it for free and walk away.

IMO something annoying about Open Source users is the thought that they tell themselves that by using the software they already did their part. You either contribute or not, using a software is not contributing to it.

## Sorry

Without contribution and with that "low" user base for me it is impossible to keep considering doing Chevereto-Free and that's why I will stop maintaining it by the end of this year. I'm sorry but I can't afford the time neither I've the resources to allocate maintainers for it.

If you are a software maintainer or know someone who may be interested in maintain Chevereto-Free please contact me.

I feel bad because I should have terminated this fork earlier as working in this wasn't a good use of my time. But I also feel great that I took 4 solid years to consider this and give it a try. I love when that shit happens, it teaches me to focus on my own experience.
