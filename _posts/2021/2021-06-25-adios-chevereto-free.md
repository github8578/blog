summary: Why I'm shutting down my Open Source software?

In 2016 I released [Chevereto-Free 1.0.0](https://github.com/Chevereto/Chevereto-Free/releases/tag/1.0.0) with the goal of building a new audience and to also discourage piracy of my stuff. I did this move because back then I really wanted to turn the entire project into a collaborative thing as I was getting too burned with the never ending "can you add X please?" or the "add this and you will make rich!" kind of feedback.

I was expecting people to join development and that some users will upgrade to paid edition progressively. The idea was also to use this Open Source edition as marketing for my stuff as the general rule of thumb is that more users equals more money.

## Users don't contribute

Chevereto-Free right now is currently used in about 4K systems and it totals a historic 10K unique installations (per domain). Out of all these it converted less than 1%, meaning that I needed another order of magnitude in distribution to get a meaningful figure, so with something in the range of 100,000 installations I could do just 1,000 licenses? The numbers won't work for me, literally the user base needs to be huge to get a decent living out of it.

But that's normal! I knew the 1% rule I don't live under a rock. Thing is that I was expecting some **collaboration** not just most people using it for free and walk away.

IMO something very annoying about Open Source users is the thought that they strongly tell themselves that by just using the software they already did their part. You either contribute or not, using a software is not contributing to it.

## Sorry

Without contribution and with that "low" user base for me it is impossible to keep considering doing Chevereto-Free and that's why I will terminate it by the end of this year. I'm sorry but I can't afford the time neither I've the resources to allocate maintainers for it. If you are a software maintainer or know someone who may be interested in maintain Chevereto-Free please contact me asap.

I feel bad because I should have terminated this fork way earlier as working in this wasn't a good use of my time. But I also feel great that I took 4 years to really consider this and give it a try. I love when that shit happens, it teaches me to focus on my own experience.
