summary: Why I'm shutting down my Open Source software?

In 2016 I released [Chevereto-Free 1.0.0](https://github.com/Chevereto/Chevereto-Free/releases/tag/1.0.0) with the goal of building a new audience and to also discourage piracy of my stuff. I did this move because back then I really wanted to turn the entire project into a collaborative thing as I was getting too burn with the never ending "can you add X please?" or the "add this and you will make rich!" kind of feedback.

I was expecting people to join development and that some users will upgrade to paid edition progressively. The idea was also to use this Open Source edition as marketing for my stuff as the general rule of thumb is that more users equals more money.

## Users don't contribute

Chevereto-Free right now is currently used in about 4K systems and it totals a historic 10K unique installations (per domain). Out of all these it converted less than 1%, meaning that I needed another order of magnitude in distribution to get a meaningful figure, so with something in the range of 100,000 installations I could do just 1,000 licenses? The numbers won't work for me, literally the user base needs to be huge to get a decent living out of it.

But that's normal! I knew the 1% rule I don't live under a rock. Thing is that I was expecting **collaboration** not just people using it for free.

IMO something very annoying about Open Source advocates is the ridiculously annoying thought that they strongly tell others that by just using the software they already did their part. For me that's the biggest shitty problem in the whole scene and I consider it a lie that users keep telling themselves for not give anything back to the software they use.

## Sorry

Without contribution and with that "low" user base for me is impossible to keep consider doing Chevereto-Free and that's why I will terminate it by the end of this year.

I feel bad because I should have terminate this fork way earlier as working in this wasn't a good use of my time. But I also feel great that I took 4 years for really considering this and give it a try. I love when that shit happens, it teach me to focus in my own experience.
